# Business case context
RPA was the entry point for my coding career. I always understood the importance of comprehensive reporting, but I disliked the amount of time required to complete those processes every single day. I started by automating these tasks using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and eventually developed long and complex macros to process large and sensitive datasets.

Soon after, these tools became insufficient when I wanted to combine the outcomes of multiple macros or automate the ETL processes involved. Later on, I wrote Python scripts that, combined with scrapers and automated scheduling, transformed the entire reporting process into an automatic cycle of navigation, extraction, processing, transformation, and export, with even the triggering mechanism being automated.

This was a crucial resource that freed my team from these duties, allowing them to invest their time in innovation and different business intelligence projects that improved my company's operations.

# Note:
This repo contains only files related to this specific objective and may lack the higher-level engine, as these resources were part of a larger software system I created. The purpose of this repo is not to provide a ready-to-use solution but to demonstrate my ability to build software relevant to its title.
